# Module-8-Artemis Steven Anderson
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  The client Artemis Financial is a banking company whose goal is a secure web platform for their customers to use with investment and banking needs. They wanted to know what security vulnerabilities were present and wanted an assessment report on what they could do to increase the security of their web software. 
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  I used the dependency reports to find vulnerabilities in the libraries and other dependneces that the software uses. This is important to code security since it can tell you what vulnerabilities have been reported and what risks they have. Allowing the company to know what they can update to increase security. Companies should always be aware of their software security since it can both add value and peace of mind. Since the security will allow the company to keep up to date on possible security weaknesses and prevent their software from being hacked or illegally accessed. 
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The part that was challenging to me was figuring out the ciphers to add to the program since I had to look up a few tutorial videos and look through the course additional resources to get a grasp on how to code those. 
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  To increase the security I added an algorithm cipher to help encrypt the software inputs. I also used certificate generation to give signed certificates for the software. I also tested it using the localhost HTTPS to check it's secure communication. I also ran dependency checks and functional tests to check for vulnerabilities and find any weaknesses and problems in the code dependencies. 
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I ran another dependency check and ran the software using a secure communication test letting me run in witha localhost. The new dependency report allowed me to compare with the previsous report and see if anything changed and if new vulnerabilities had been added. 
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  For the future the resources I used to find the cipher code methods will definately help me. I also think the functional testing methods I can use for my future programming. I also think the practice with other file types in a program and altering them will be helpful like with the pom.xml file. 
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would show the fixed code with the cipher added and show what I worked on with the pom.xml file. I would also show them the work I did with the dependency reports and the suppression file to show my understanding of the vulnerabiliy report.
